In the 2020’s it has become a consensus amongst many 18–24-year-olds to be anti-establishment. This can be explained for a number of reasons; media bias, unethical practises from the elite to name a few. Social media has allowed the younger generations to have their say, which is becoming both a negative and positive aspect of today’s society. 

A lot of the narratives that young people are pushing today to many, mostly the older generations, are down-right laughable. Take for example the recent George Floyd case that has swept the world this past 12 months. At first it appears that a police officer in America has unlawfully murdered a man that happened to be of an ‘ethnic minority’. This, as expected, caused a rippling effect across society to the point where it became political ammunition for numerous institutions. Ultimately this specific case, along with the similar cases that followed, have created an ‘anti-white’ narrative. White people across the world are being demonised for something that has been blown out of proportion. 

Firstly, let’s look at the statistics surrounding police violence in America, considering all races that are present in the country. At this point I am focusing on America as it seems the goings on in that nation seem to be affecting the wider world, which is to be expected…

On average young white males living within America are twice as likely to be killed, when comparing that to Black individuals. In 2020 alone there were a total of 457 white people shot by police with a total of 241 deaths being recorded for Black people. In fact, for a total of 4 years White people have been killed more by police for a total of 4 years running. Each of those years having nearly a 50% difference. An interesting take if you ask me. 

Now do not get me wrong, George Floyd did not deserve to die. But what must be understood is the media’s involvement in creating half of a story when covering this case. Many news channels and articles originally failed to give any sort of context to the situation, other than “a black man has once again died at the hands of the police”. Firstly, George Floyd had a past, a pretty dark one at that. Secondly, the reason the police were initially called was due to the fact that Floyd was in fact committing a crime as he was using counterfeit money at a storefront. Thirdly, this man was on a deadly cocktail of controlled substances. This included a large amount of fentanyl. Autopsy reports later found that he was actually on 3x the amount someone should have been on. This can explain the eccentric behaviour displayed by him when looking at released police cams. 

Had It not been for his eccentric behaviour it is concludable that the restraining techniques used by Derek Chauvin would not have been used, thus not resulting in his death. Drugs such as fentanyl effect the breathing of users as do many high-class drugs, this ultimately added to the situation creating the horrible turn of events. 

The dangerous part about all of this is the lack of transparency from the Left-Wing commentators that are present amongst Twitter and Instagram. Fact checks are lacking in user generated posts that ultimately are pushing these narratives that have been mentioned above. This creates a ‘sheep mentality’, as people post more people see these posts and continue the cycle of misinformation being spread. White people are turning on white people in this new form of ‘White Knight-ness’. 
Next, we must highlight the idea of ‘Black Lives Matter’. As a phrase this works, no one believes they do not matter, only a racist would say otherwise. As an organisation however it is majorly flawed. It is heavily influenced by Marxist ideology, which is renowned for being, aggressive you could say. The anti-fascists become fascists, and this can be seen through the use of violent protests and violent reactions towards the other side. Innocent bystanders and business’ have become victims to something they never signed up. 

What’s interesting about all of this is the fact the people engaging with the violent side of the protests would stereotypically be against the establishment, fitting that Marxist description. But they seem to be destroying small, independent business’ that are in some cases ran by families on a small scale. Another interesting take. 

Socialism in today’s society definitely is a mood changer. In a world that is govern by consumerism and personal gain, socialism doesn’t really work. Most people have no time for it, which is no surprise when looking throughout history at the cases of socialism that have not ended well or are currently not working. It appears though that the COVID-19 pandemic has given many young individuals more time to spend on the internet. Only a small minority though, as it appears to be privileged university students at the front of this ongoing battle. 

Is it to combat their parent’s beliefs? Have their parents cut off money to spend on alcohol and drugs? Who knows, but what I can tell you is how little some of these perpetrators have contributed to Britain’s economy in terms of hours worked. Maybe mind-bending drugs need to be put down for a second so a few books can be read on this topic of socialism. We all know how the Soviet Union ended up. 

One thing I can’t help but notice is the idea of socialism being prevalent amongst young people who love to line the pockets of the supposed corporations that they despise. It does not take much analysis of online profiles posting this propaganda to work out patterns and trends. A lot of these individuals can be found head to toe in designer and branded clothing, eating out at fancy chain restaurants posing for their online followers (most of which will be carbon copies of one another) that they communicate with off of their smart phones. 

And this is where the idea of ‘Starbucks Marxists’ comes from. Individuals who believe in Marx, but at the same time are going behind his back biting the hands that feed. A strange phenomenon of recent times, that short dopamine hit today’s youth get from consumerism is the equivalent to becoming addicted to a controlled substance. 

If you are a young person reading this, I can advise Deleting social media is a great way to avoid a lot of this rubbish. At least in real life you are not bombarded with this “anti-white, pro victim, I hate capitalism” kafuffle as a lot of the time it doesn’t go beyond Social Media. Political conversations between younger generations are becoming ever more one sided due the emerging ‘Cancel Culture’, another element of Mau’s China, but that’s for another day…
